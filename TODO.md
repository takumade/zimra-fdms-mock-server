# Todo
✅ Device endpoints  <br>
✅ Public endpoints  <br>
✅ User endpoints  <br>
✅ ProductsStock endpoints  <br>
⏳ Make mock server as realistic as possible  <br>


## Realism

⏳ Mock expired certificate response at middleware level <br>
⏳ Mock server error response at middleware level <br>
⏳ Add realistic token <br>
⏳ Implement realistic device check <br>
⏳ Implement realistic certificate check <br>

### More research needed
⏳ Implement realistic user check (maybe not necessary) {use sqlite here} <br>
⏳ Implement realistic products stock check (maybe not necessary) {use sqlite here} <br>
⏳ Implement realistic day check (maybe not necessary) {use sqlite here} <br>
