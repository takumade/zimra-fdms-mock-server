# ZIMRA FDMS Mock Server

This is a mock server designed to simulate requests and responses as specified in the ZIMRA FDMS API documentation: https://fdmsapitest.zimra.co.zw/swagger/index.html

This mock server is particularly useful for developers who do not have immediate access to a fiscalized ID. However, please note that it is recommended to test with the original server whenever possible, as the responses may differ from those provided by this mock implementation.
